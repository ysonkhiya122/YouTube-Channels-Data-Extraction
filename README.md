# YouTube-Channels-Data-Extraction
The project aims to gather and analyze data for the top 50 YouTube channels associated with each Media network channel across different languages. The goal is to clean and preprocess the raw data, extract essential channel information using the YouTube Data API, and compile the final dataset into a structured format for further analysis.
